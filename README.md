# CodeAcademyGame
Text-Based Console Maze

I was doing a refresher for c# and codeacademy asked me to make a game using conditionals and switches. Since there were no checks and balances I decided to stray from their copy and paste instructions and make it my way using a few advanced alternatives.

What we have here is a text-based maze. It is very short, don't expect Call of Duty, it's not like I get paid to write this stuff unfortunately. It is still a WIP and features:
  -WASD movement controls
  -Investigate your location feature using L key
  -Pickup items using the P key
  -3 keys for unlocking the escape door.
  
 As it stands right now you can actually escape the maze without the use of the keys. If I fancy getting more in depth on this project then I'll load it up in Visual Studio IDE to really have at it, but for now I just wanted to see how far I could take codeacademy's sandbox editor before getting bored and wanting to move on.
